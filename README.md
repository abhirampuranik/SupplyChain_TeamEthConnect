<ins>Problem Statement</ins>
The vaccine supply chain has a lot of vulnerabilities which are being exploited in times of necessity. 
There are corruption risks throughout the entire vaccination deployment process. 
Vaccines may be stolen from the public supply chain during the transportation process and diverted to the black market or kept for personal use. 
Allocation of vaccines to priority groups is a drawback of traditional supply chain. Public do not have complete knowledge of amount of vaccines available.
2. This problem comes under Supply chain and Inventory management.
Distribution of resources(vaccines) based on demand.
Transparent and traceable Supply Chain.
Privacy and security.
